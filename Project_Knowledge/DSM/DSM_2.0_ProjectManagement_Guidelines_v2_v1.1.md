## Purpose

This document provides a standardized framework for planning, executing, and documenting data science projects.  
It ensures consistency, efficiency, and clarity across all phases â€” from data preparation to modeling and deployment.

**Objective:** Establish a clear, time-bound, and reproducible plan that delivers measurable outcomes aligned with business goals.

---

## Project Structure Overview

Each project plan should include the following core sections:

1. **Purpose**
   - Define the projectâ€™s main objective and deliverable.
   - Describe the expected impact or business value.
   - Specify available resources and time allocation.

2. **Inputs & Dependencies**
   - List all input datasets and their key characteristics (record count, features, source).
   - Reference outputs or dependencies from prior project phases.
   - Document data quality assumptions and preprocessing status.

### Technical Prerequisites

Before beginning Phase 1 work:

**Environment Setup:**
Run base environment setup script:
- Academic/exploratory: `setup_base_environment_minimal.py`
- Production/team: `setup_base_environment_prod.py`

**Environment Requirements:**
- Python virtual environment (`.venv`)
- Base packages installed (see Methodology Section 2.1 (Phase 0: Environment Setup))

### Template 5: Time Buffer Allocation Guidance

**Recommended Buffer Strategy:**

When planning each phase, allocate buffers to account for unexpected issues:

| Phase Duration | Recommended Buffer | Example                          |
| -------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| 1-2 days       | 15% buffer         | 4 hours work = 4.6 hours planned |
| 3-5 days       | 20% buffer         | 20 hours work = 24 hours planned |
| 1 sprint+      | 25% buffer         | 40 hours work = 50 hours planned |

**Buffer Allocation Guidelines:**
- Include buffer in timeline estimates, not as separate line item
- Use buffer for: unexpected data issues, stakeholder requests, learning new tools
- If buffer unused, apply to quality improvements or next phase prep
- Document actual time spent vs. planned to improve future estimates

**Example Planning:**
```markdown
Sprint 2: Feature Engineering
- Core work: 16 hours
- Buffer (20%): 4 hours
- Total planned: 20 hours (adjust daily breakdown based on sprint configuration)

Daily breakdown (example for 5-day sprint):
- Day 1: 3.2 hours core + 0.8 buffer = 4 hours
- Day 2: 3.2 hours core + 0.8 buffer = 4 hours
[...]
```

**Risk-Based Buffer Adjustment:**
- High uncertainty (new tools/methods): +25-30% buffer
- Medium uncertainty (familiar work): +15-20% buffer
- Low uncertainty (repeated tasks): +10-15% buffer

---

## Advanced Planning Framework: Version 2.0 Enhancements

**When to use Version 2.0 planning:**
- First time executing a complex phase with uncertain estimates
- Projects with substantial buffer (>20%) worth protecting
- Phases prone to scope creep (exploration, feature engineering, analysis)
- When daily reflection and mid-course correction add value
- Multi-day phases (3-5+ days) where early drift detection matters

**Core principle:** Invest 15 minutes daily in structured reflection to enable agile adaptation and protect buffer health.

---

### Template 6: Daily Checkpoint Framework

**Purpose:** Enable systematic daily review to detect drift, adjust scope, and maintain buffer discipline.

**Time allocation:** 15 minutes at end of each working day (built into buffer)

**Format:**
```markdown
## Day X Checkpoint - [Phase Name] (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Format:**
```markdown
## Cumulative Buffer Tracking

| Checkpoint             | Buffer Allocated | Buffer Used | Buffer Remaining       | Notes                         |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| [Prior Phase] Complete | [X]h allocated   | [Y]h actual | +[X-Y]h surplus        | [Efficiency %]                |

**Buffer Management Strategy:**
- If Days 1-2 under budget â†’ Proceed with full scope
- If Days 1-2 on budget â†’ Maintain current scope
- If Days 1-2 over budget â†’ Reduce scope (SHOULD â†’ MUST only)
- Critical threshold: If buffer drops below [X]h after Day 3, trigger contingency plan
```

| Sprint 2 Start    | +4h (20%)        | 0h          | **12.5h total**  | Strong buffer position           |
| End of Day 1      | 0.8h             | 0.5h        | 12.3h            | Ahead of schedule                |
| End of Day 2      | 1.6h cumulative  | 1.4h        | 11.6h            | On track                         |
| End of Day 3      | 2.4h cumulative  | 2.8h        | 10.9h            | **Healthy - proceed**            |
| End of Day 4      | 3.2h cumulative  | 3.5h        | 10.6h            | Slightly over, manageable        |
| End of Day 5      | 4h cumulative    | 4.2h        | 10.3h            | Final buffer: 10.3h for Sprint 3 |

**Buffer Management Strategy:**
- If Days 1-2 under budget â†’ Proceed with all SHOULD + COULD features
- If Days 1-2 on budget â†’ Complete all SHOULD, selective COULD
- If Days 1-2 over budget â†’ Focus on MUST + SHOULD only, skip COULD
- Critical threshold: If buffer drops below 8h after Day 3, trigger contingency
```

### Template 9: MUST/SHOULD/COULD Priority Framework

**Purpose:** Structured prioritization to prevent "everything is important" paralysis and enable clear scope reduction decisions.

**When to use:** Complex phases with >10 deliverables, risk of scope creep, or uncertain capacity

**Framework:**

**MUST Deliverables (20-30% of total):**
- Critical for phase completion
- Blocks next phase if incomplete
- Non-negotiable, even if behind schedule
- Complete first, validate thoroughly

**SHOULD Deliverables (50-60% of total):**
- High value, expected if on schedule
- Enhances quality but not strictly blocking
- Complete if Days 1-2 on/under budget
- Skip selectively if behind schedule

**COULD Deliverables (10-20% of total):**
- Bonus features if ahead of schedule
- Exploratory or "nice to have"
- First to cut when time constrained
- Defer to future phases if needed

**Format:**
```markdown
## Success Criteria - Structured by Priority

**MUST Deliverables ([X] total - Non-negotiable):**
- [ ] [Deliverable 1] - [Description]
- [ ] [Deliverable 2] - [Description]
- [ ] [Deliverable 3] - [Description]

**SHOULD Deliverables ([X] total - Complete if on schedule):**
- [ ] [Deliverable 4] - [Description]
- [ ] [Deliverable 5] - [Description]
- [ ] [Deliverable 6] - [Description]

**COULD Deliverables ([X] total - Only if ahead):**
- [ ] [Deliverable 7] - [Description]
- [ ] [Deliverable 8] - [Description]

**Contingency Rules:**
- If on schedule after Day 2 â†’ Full scope (MUST + SHOULD + COULD)
- If 10-20% behind after Day 2 â†’ MUST + SHOULD only
- If >20% behind after Day 2 â†’ MUST only, document deferred work
```

**Example:**
```markdown
## Success Criteria - Structured by Priority

**MUST Deliverables (4 total - Non-negotiable):**
- [ ] Data quality assessment complete (outliers, missing values, validation)
- [ ] Core temporal features created (date components, basic aggregations)
- [ ] Primary visualizations generated (time series, distributions, correlations)
- [ ] Clean dataset exported for next phase

**SHOULD Deliverables (6 total - Complete if on schedule):**
- [ ] Store-level analysis (performance comparison, clustering)
- [ ] Product dynamics analysis (fast/slow movers, Pareto)
- [ ] External factor investigation (holidays, promotions)
- [ ] Advanced visualizations (heatmaps, interaction plots)
- [ ] Preliminary feature importance analysis
- [ ] Comprehensive decision log with rationale

**COULD Deliverables (3 total - Only if ahead):**
- [ ] Three-method outlier detection (IQR + Z-score + Isolation Forest)
- [ ] Transaction pattern analysis (basket size, traffic)
- [ ] Perishable waste risk modeling

**Contingency Rules:**
- If on schedule after Day 2 â†’ Full scope (13 deliverables)
- If 10-20% behind after Day 2 â†’ MUST + SHOULD only (10 deliverables)
- If >20% behind after Day 2 â†’ MUST only (4 deliverables), document deferred
```

### Template 10: End-of-Day Checkpoint Questions

**Purpose:** Quality gates to prevent compounding errors and ensure readiness for next day.

**When to use:** Embed 3-5 critical questions at the end of each day's deliverables section.

**Categories of checkpoint questions:**

**1. Technical Validation Questions:**
- Is [technical requirement] correctly implemented?
- Did validation confirm [expected behavior]?
- Are [metrics] within expected ranges?
- Should we adjust [approach] based on findings?

**2. Quality Assessment Questions:**
- Does output meet [quality standard]?
- Are visualizations clear and interpretable?
- Is documentation complete and accurate?
- Are there any silent errors or edge cases?

**3. Scope Management Questions:**
- Did we complete all planned parts within [X]h budget?
- Should we add/remove analyses for next day?
- Are findings interesting enough to warrant deeper exploration?
- Do we need to adjust next day's scope?

**4. Readiness Questions:**
- Are prerequisites met for next day's work?
- Is intermediate dataset saved and validated?
- Are blockers documented and addressed?
- Do we have clarity on tomorrow's objectives?

**Format (embed at end of each day's section):**
```markdown
#### **End-of-Day X Checkpoint** âš ï¸

**Critical Review Questions:**
1. [Technical validation question]?
2. [Quality assessment question]?
3. [Scope management question]?
4. [Readiness question]?
5. [Budget/schedule question]?

**Adjustment Options:**
- If ahead of schedule â†’ [Expansion option]
- If behind schedule â†’ [Reduction option]
- If [condition] found â†’ [Mitigation action]

**Use Daily Checkpoint Template (Section [X]) to document decisions.**
```

**Example:**
```markdown
#### **End-of-Day 2 Checkpoint** âš ï¸

**Critical Review Questions:**
1. Are rolling windows (7/14/30 days) smoothing noise as expected?
2. Did min_periods=1 reduce NaN to <1% as planned?
3. Are high-volatility items identifiable for further analysis?
4. Should we add rolling max/min features tomorrow (optional)?
5. Are we on track for external data integration (Day 3)?

**Adjustment Options:**
- If ahead of schedule â†’ Add rolling max/min features on Day 3
- If behind schedule â†’ Reduce Day 3 scope to core features only
- If smoothing insufficient â†’ Revisit window sizes on Day 3

**Use Daily Checkpoint Template (Section 11) to document decisions.**
```

### Template 12: Scope Limitations Log

**Purpose:** Transparently document what is OUT of scope and why

**When to Create:** Sprint 1 (after scope finalized)

**When to Update:** Whenever scope boundary discovered or confirmed

**Filename:** `scope_limitations.md`

**Location:** `docs/`

**Template:**

```markdown
# Scope Limitations - [Project Name]

**Project:** [Name]
**Last Updated:** [Date]
**Version:** [X]

---

## In Scope

**Included in this analysis:**
- [What IS covered - be specific]
- [What IS covered - include metrics if relevant]
- [What IS covered - reference decisions if applicable]

**Example:**
- OK: Guayas region (11 stores, 73.8% in Guayaquil)
- OK: Top-3 product families: GROCERY I, BEVERAGES, CLEANING (59% of catalog)
- OK: Non-perishable items only (2,296 items, 0% perishable)
- OK: Daily sales forecasting (March 2014 test period)
- OK: 300K sample for development, full dataset for validation

---

## Out of Scope

**Excluded from this analysis:**
- [What is NOT covered] - **Reason:** [Why excluded - resource/time/data/priority]
- [What is NOT covered] - **Reason:** [Why excluded]

**Example:**
- ERROR: Perishable categories (PRODUCE, DAIRY, MEATS, BREAD/BAKERY)
  - **Reason:** Top-3 families contain 0% perishables (per DEC-010). Perishables require different forecasting approach (daily vs weekly), shorter forecast horizons, higher accuracy requirements. Out of scope for 4-sprint timeline.

- ERROR: Regions outside Guayas (43 stores in other provinces)
  - **Reason:** Guayas provides sufficient variety (11 stores, mixed types) for methodology validation. Other regions may have different climate, demographics, product mix. Expanding to national scope would triple data volume and complexity, exceeding 4-sprint timeline.

---

## Discovered Limitations

**Limitations identified during analysis:**

| Item | Discovered When | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|-----------------|--------|------------|--------|
| [Limitation] | [Sprint X, Day Y] | [Effect on project] | [How we addressed it] | [Accepted/Workaround/Future] |

**Example:**
| Item | Discovered When | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|-----------------|--------|------------|--------|
| Perishables 0% in sample | Sprint 1, Day 5 | Cannot forecast PRODUCE, DAIRY | Document limitation, note for Phase 2 | Accepted |
| 16% missing promotions (2013-2014) | Sprint 1, Day 3 | Cannot distinguish no-promo vs not-tracked | Fill with 0 (conservative assumption per DEC-003) | Workaround |

---

## Future Scope Expansion

**Potential additions for Phase 2 or future work:**

1. **[Potential addition]**
   - **Effort estimate:** [Hours/sprints]
   - **Value proposition:** [Business benefit]
   - **Prerequisites:** [What needs to happen first]
   - **Priority:** High / Medium / Low
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents stakeholder surprise ("why didn't you do X?")
- Documents justification for scope decisions
- Creates roadmap for future phases
- Demonstrates project management discipline
- Protects against scope creep

### Enhanced Risk Management for Version 2.0 Plans

**Additional risks to consider when using v2.0 framework:**

| Risk                                             | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope creep during exploration**               | Medium     | Medium | Daily checkpoints maintain MUST/SHOULD/COULD discipline   |
| **Daily checkpoint overhead exceeds 15 min**     | Low        | Low    | Template streamlines process, set timer                   |
| **Interesting findings trigger scope expansion** | Medium     | Medium | Defer deep dives to future phases, document for later     |
| **False precision in daily tracking**            | Low        | Low    | Focus on trends (ahead/on/behind), not exact minutes      |
| **Checkpoint fatigue in long phases**            | Low        | Medium | Reduce frequency after Sprint 1, maintain at key milestones |

---

### Communication Plan Enhancement for Version 2.0

**Add to existing communication plan:**

```markdown
### Daily Checkpoints ([Phase Name])
- **Timing:** End of each day (last 15 minutes)
- **Format:** Structured review using checkpoint template (Section [X])
- **Content:**
  - Time tracking (actual vs allocated)
  - Scope completion (all parts done?)
  - Quality assessment (outputs validated?)
  - Findings (unexpected discoveries?)
  - Adjustment decisions (add/remove tasks for next day?)
- **Output:** Daily checkpoint document (Day[X]_Checkpoint_[Phase].md)
- **Cumulative tracking:** Update buffer table after each checkpoint
- **Purpose:** Enable agile adaptation, prevent scope creep, maintain buffer discipline
```

---

### Decision Tree: Should You Use Version 2.0 Planning?

**Use Version 1.0 (Standard) if:**
- âœ“ Experienced with this type of work (know what to expect)
- âœ“ High confidence in estimates (Â±10% accuracy)
- âœ“ Limited documentation time (<5% of phase duration)
- âœ“ Straightforward scope with minimal uncertainty
- âœ“ Short phase duration (1-2 days)

**Use Version 2.0 (Enhanced) if:**
- âœ“ First time doing this type of work (uncertain estimates)
- âœ“ Low confidence in estimates (Â±20%+ uncertainty)
- âœ“ Substantial buffer worth protecting (>20% or carryover)
- âœ“ Complex scope prone to drift or creep
- âœ“ Multi-day phase where early detection matters (3-5+ days)
- âœ“ High value of systematic reflection and adjustment
- âœ“ Learning objective (want to improve estimation over time)

**Cost-Benefit Analysis:**
- **Cost:** 15 min/day Ã— [N] days = [X] hours overhead
- **Benefit:** Protect [Y] hours of buffer, enable [Z] adjustments
- **ROI:** If overhead <5% of phase duration and buffer >15%, use v2.0

---

### Version 2.0 Best Practices

**1. Commit to the discipline:**
- Set aside exactly 15 minutes at end of each day
- Use a timer to prevent checkpoint bloat
- Complete checkpoint before closing for the day

**2. Be honest in assessments:**
- Variance explanations are for learning, not blame
- Document real blockers, not excuses
- Adjust scope proactively when behind

**3. Focus on trends, not precision:**
- "Ahead/On/Behind" is sufficient granularity
- Don't obsess over exact minutes
- Buffer health (Healthy/Caution/Critical) guides decisions

**4. Use checkpoints for agility:**
- Scope adjustments are normal and expected
- MUST/SHOULD/COULD framework enables clean cuts
- Deferred work is documented, not abandoned

**5. Carry learnings forward:**
- Checkpoint notes inform next phase planning
- Variance patterns improve future estimates
- Adjustment decisions build project wisdom

**6. Know when to stop:**
- If phase consistently on schedule, reduce checkpoint frequency
- If estimates become accurate (Â±5%), revert to v1.0
- If checkpoint takes >20 min, simplify template

---

### Integration with Existing Templates

**Where to add Version 2.0 elements in project plans:**

**Section 3 (Timeline):**
- Add cumulative buffer tracking table (Template 8)

**Section 4 (Deliverables):**
- Add end-of-day checkpoint questions after each day (Template 10)

**Section 6 (Success Criteria):**
- Restructure using MUST/SHOULD/COULD framework (Template 9)

**Section 8 (Risk Management):**
- Add scope creep, checkpoint overhead, and exploration drift risks

**Section 9 (Expected Outcomes):**
- Replace 2-stage table with 3-stage progressive table (Template 7)

**Section 10 (Communication Plan):**
- Add "Daily Checkpoints" subsection with template reference

**New Section 11:**
- Add complete Daily Checkpoint Template (Template 6)

---

**End of Version 2.0 Planning Framework**

**Summary:** Version 2.0 planning adds structured daily discipline through 15-minute checkpoints, progressive tracking, and priority tiers to enable agile adaptation and protect buffer health in complex, multi-day phases with uncertain scope.

**When in doubt:** Use v2.0 for critical phases and first-time work; revert to v1.0 once confidence and accuracy are established.

**Requirements:**
- **Professional language only.** Avoid informal expressions and personal opinions.  
- **No emojis or decorative symbols** in any document or notebook.  
- **Each section** of a markdown or project plan must include a **short, informative description** summarizing its content and intent.  
- **Each Jupyter Notebook cell** must:
  - Contain a short markdown description explaining what the cell does.  
  - Generate **at least one visible output** (table, plot, metric, or print statement) to demonstrate results or intermediate checks.  
- **Formatting consistency** should be prioritized â€” all text, tables, and figures must be clear, aligned, and free of unnecessary embellishments.  
- **Comments in code** should be brief, meaningful, and written in complete sentences where relevant.

This section ensures the deliverables communicate technical rigor and are accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### Character and Symbol Restrictions

To ensure compatibility across all systems and maintain professional standards:

**Prohibited:**
- Emojis of any kind (no âœ… âŒ âš ï¸ ðŸ“Š ðŸ” etc.)
- Unicode checkmarks or symbols (no âœ“ âœ—)
- Special decorative characters

**Required:**
- Standard markdown checkboxes: `[ ]` for incomplete, `[x]` for complete

| **Sprint 2**| Feature engineering        | Analytical base and feature dictionary                    |
| **Sprint 3**| Modeling & validation      | Trained models, evaluation reports                        |
| **Sprint 4**| Deployment & reporting     | Production pipeline, stakeholder presentation             |

---

## Best Practices

- **Environment Setup:** Complete environment configuration (Day 0) before beginning analysis work. Generate domain-specific package scripts based on project documentation. See Methodology Section 2.1 (Phase 0: Environment Setup) for automated setup procedures.
- **Modularization:** Structure notebooks by phase (e.g., `01_data_cleaning.ipynb`, `02_feature_engineering.ipynb`).
- **Reproducibility:** Store parameters, transformations, and random seeds.
- **Transparency:** Keep assumptions and exclusions explicit.
- **Version Control:** Commit all code and documents to Git with descriptive messages.
- **Documentation:** Maintain a centralized README linking datasets, notebooks, and reports.
- **Validation:** Integrate both statistical and business validation for each phase.
- **Communication:** Provide concise daily or sprint summaries of progress and blockers.

## File Naming Standards

**Notebooks:**
- Working development: `sYY_dXX_PHASE_description.ipynb` (e.g., `s01_d01_EDA_data_quality.ipynb`)
- Final deliverables: `XX_PHASE_description.ipynb` (e.g., `01_EDA_data_quality_cohort.ipynb`)
- Consolidation occurs in Phase 4 (Sprint 4)

See Collaboration Methodology for complete naming conventions.
